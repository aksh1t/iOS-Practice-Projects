README for iOS-Practice-Projects

This Repository contains projects which I made while learning iOS (with the exception of ThreadingTestApp, which I downloaded from a blog to see a working example for Multithreading). These Projects mostly contain basic stuff, which have been summarised below. Note that some of the projects might not display correctly with iOS 7 because they have been made with iOS 5 and Xcode 4.6.

	•	Calculator - A simple working calculator.

	•	CocoaPodsExample - Tutorial project for integrating various pods into the project.

	•	Components - A project which I made to check out various iOS components.

	•	CustomTableApp - This project is somewhat like the Contacts App. Stores information using NSUserDefaults.

	•	DrinkMixer - Example from the HeadFirst iOS book. Shows a list of drinks and their recipes which can be edited. Data stored in plist file.

	•	iDecide - The first example from HeadFirst iOS book. Just one button which changes text on clicking.

	•	InstaEmail - Another simple example from the same book. Shows a MFMailComposeViewController after selecting and writing your message.

	•	MultiView - An application which has two views switching to and from one another with different animations.

	•	SMSTest - POC for sending SMS in iDevices. Can’t send SMS without the default MessageController popping up, so not much use for sending SMS through code.

	•	StoryboardTutorial - Experimentation with Storyboards and segue transitions and animations.

	•	TestTableAnimation - Playing around with UITable cells moving around animations.

	•	ThreadingTestApp - This app is a downloaded demo for Multithreading.

	•	UITableViewDemo - An example for using UISearchBar with a UITableView just like the contacts app.

	•	PageControlExample - An example demonstrating UIScrollView with paging vertically.
