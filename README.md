=====

These are some projects which I made or while learning iOS. These projects mostly contain basic stuff, which has been summarised below. Note that some of the projects might not display correctly with iOS 7 and above because they have been made with iOS 5 and Xcode 4.6.

* __Components__ - A project which I made to check out various iOS components.

* __CustomTableApp__ - This project is somewhat like the Contacts App. Stores information using NSUserDefaults.

* __DrinkMixer__ - Example from the HeadFirst iOS book. Shows a list of drinks and their recipes which can be edited. Data stored in plist file.

* __iDecide__ - The first example from HeadFirst iOS book. Just one button which changes text on clicking.
